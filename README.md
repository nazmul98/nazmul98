Hey there,  I’m a Passionate Programmer, specializing in mostly JavaScript & React, but also write PHP and some other stuff. I’m also passionate about writing and sharing what I’ve learned with community. I try to leave every bit I code I touch more readable, modular, performant and accessible than I found it.
